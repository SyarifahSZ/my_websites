      Biodata
    </h2>

    <font size="medium" style="text-align:center;">

      <p>
        My name is Syarifah Zahidah binti Suarel, and I was born on 29th March 2005 at Hospital Seremban, Negeri
        Sembilan. I am currently a student at Universiti Teknologi Mara, Kampus Rembau, Cawangan Negeri Sembilan, where
        I
        am pursuing my studies in a Diploma in Information Management. I come from a loving family of five people, and I
        am very grateful for their support and encouragement in everything I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself an introvert with someone who is a stranger to me, but an extrovert who is close to me, so it
        is
        an ambivert. I enjoy learning new things and always try to give my best in every situation. My hobbies include
        playing badminton, watching movies, and watching YouTube. These activities help me relax and express my
        creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I am not particularly proud of who I am today, but I am grateful for what I have, as some people cannot
        achieve what I have. I look forward to improving myself and building a bright future.
      </p>

      Fun Facts
    </h2>

    <font size="medium" style="text-align:center;">

      <p>
        I want to share some fun facts about myself. First of all, I am a person who loves to laugh and make others
        smile.
        I believe that happiness is contagious, so I always try to spread positive energy wherever I go.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another interesting aspect of me is my passion for my hobby is playing badminton, because that’s the thing that
        I
        really look forward to since I was a kid. My hobby is also taking pictures of sunsets and sunrises, but
        sometimes,
        because I'm not a morning person. In the old days, I had thought that I wanted to be a photographer, but maybe
        one
        day as a part-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        A fun fact that surprises many people is that I am shy at first but talkative later when I'm really comfortable
        with people around me, and scared of cats but love cat videos. I think these little contradictions make me who I
        am — a mix of funny, curious, and unique!

      High School
    </h2>

    <font size="medium" style="text-align:center;">
      <p>
        My education journey in high school was one of the most memorable and meaningful experiences in my life. I
        studied at Sekolah Menengah Agama Rembau, but now it has changed to Sekolah Menengah Agama Haji Ibrahim Rembau,
        where I spent five and a half of learning, growing, and building strong friendships. High school was a time when
        I not only focused on my studies but also discovered my interests and potential. I am the one as a school
        prefect, and it taught me many valuable lessons. I learned the importance of time management, discipline, and
        respect for others.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my time in high school, I studied various subjects such as Lughah Al-Muasirah, Usul Al-Din, As-Syariah,
        Economy as an additional subject, Mathematics, Science, History, and Bahasa Melayu. Among all these subjects, my
        favorite is Economics because I find it both interesting and challenging. My teachers were very supportive and
        always encouraged me to do my best in every subject.

      Diploma
    </h2>

    <font size="medium" style="text-align:center;">
      <p>
        My education journey at the diploma level has been an important and rewarding chapter in my life. I am currently
        pursuing a Diploma in Information Management at Universiti Teknologi Mara, Kampus Rembau, Cawangan Negeri
        Sembilan. This program has provided me with the opportunity to gain both academic knowledge and practical
        experience that are valuable for my future career.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my diploma studies, I learned various subjects related to my field, such as Records Management,
        Information
        Technology, Communication Skills, and Management. These subjects helped me understand the theoretical and
        practical aspects of my course. I also developed important skills such as critical thinking, teamwork, and
        problem-solving through assignments, group projects, and presentations.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the most memorable parts of my diploma education was my industrial training (internship). It allowed me
        to
        experience real working conditions and apply the knowledge I had learned in class. I gained confidence, improved
        my communication skills, and learned how to manage responsibilities in a professional environment.
      </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">
      Future Degree
    </h2>

    <font size="medium" style="text-align:center;">
      <p>
        After completing my diploma, my next goal is to continue my studies at the degree level. I plan to pursue a
        Bachelor of Information Science (Hons) Information Systems Management at Universiti Teknologi Mara, Kampus
        Puncak Perdana, Cawangan Selangor. Continuing my education is very important to me because I believe that
        learning is a lifelong journey that helps a person grow both academically and personally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through my future degree studies, I hope to gain deeper knowledge and a wider understanding of my chosen field.
        I want to explore more advanced topics that I can use in a working environment soon. This will help me build a
        strong academic foundation and prepare for a professional career in the future.
