          <p>
            My work experience as a teacher in a kindergarten and as a KAFA
            teacher has been one of the most meaningful experiences in my life.
            Teaching young children requires patience, creativity, and
            dedication, and I am grateful for the opportunity to guide and
            educate them during their early learning years.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the kindergarten, I was responsible for teaching basic subjects
            such as reading, writing, counting, and moral values. I also planned
            fun learning activities to make lessons more interesting and
            enjoyable for the children. Through this experience, I learned how
            to communicate effectively with young learners and create a positive
            learning environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Besides teaching in kindergarten, I also taught KAFA (Kelas Agama
            Fardhu Ain) classes. In these classes, I focused on teaching Islamic
            knowledge, prayers, and good manners. This experience strengthened
            my understanding of Islamic education and improved my ability to
            teach religious values with kindness and patience.

            <p>
              My internship experience was one of the most valuable parts of my
              educational journey. It gave me the opportunity to apply what I
              had learned in class to a real working environment and helped me
              gain a better understanding of my future career.
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed my internship at Pejabat Pendidikan Daerah Rembau,
              where I worked for two months as an intern in the Sektor
              Perancangan. The internship taught me the importance of
              discipline, responsibility, and maintaining a positive attitude at
              work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had the chance to observe how an organization operates and how
              teamwork contributes to achieving goals. My supervisors and
              colleagues were very supportive and guided me whenever I faced
              challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this experience, I gained more confidence and a clearer
              vision of my career path. It made me realize that every task, no
              matter how small, plays a role in the success of an organization.
              I also learned to appreciate the value of continuous learning and
              self-improvement.
